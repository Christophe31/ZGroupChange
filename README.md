# ZGroupChange
This mod designet to work with all  [Supported Mods](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Progsy/ZGroupChange/discussion/1801 "Supported Mods") enabled all together for better experience.

# Short discription: 
 - No need more mess with whole bunch of mods and their groups. Even vanilla groups has been rearranged.
 - Recipes/Items regrouping.
 - Added new and using existing technology for all new items (Yuoki especially)
 - Removing or disabling similar/unused/unbalanced items which come from different mods
 - Added few new items to "plug a hole"
 - Depending on enabled mods - almost all basic resources getting, in additional, new minable resources.
 - Possibility to configure balance changes (see config.lua). Now you can play with settings as you wish up to completely disable all changes (only grouping and sorting will stay intact).
 - Mod developed to allow easily and safely add support for any new mods. You can use your own custom regroup settings. See ZGroupChange\mods\\_custom\_TEMPLATE.lua fo details.
